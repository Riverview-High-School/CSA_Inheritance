# RHS AP CSA Inheritance

Inheritance is one of the three pillars of Object-Oriented Programming which allows for the creation of heirarchial entities.

In Java, where all entities are of a class, the class from which properties and behaviors are inherited are referred to as the superclass. The syntactal keyword bing super. - lower case.

In order for a class to inherit from a superclass, the keyword extends is used to designate the relationship.
